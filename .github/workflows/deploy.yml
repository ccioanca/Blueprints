          # Since the project is hosted at the root of the repository, the `dist` directory will be directly published.
          # The default branch for GitHub Pages is `gh-pages`, but we can configure it to use `main` or a custom branch.
          # For simplicity, we'll let `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` handle the `gh-pages` branch creation and deployment.
